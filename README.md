=====================
[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/palantir/gradle-npm-run-plugin.svg?style=shield&circle-token=012397ab761aa8f59276b2ac7babb51d80a12a7c)](https://circleci.com/gh/palantir/gradle-npm-run-plugin)

A Gradle Plugin to create lifecycle tasks that trigger `npm run` commands.

Usage
-----
1. [Apply the plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.palantir.npm-run)
1. Add `npm` to your `devDependencies` block in your `package.json`
1. Configure your `package.json` `scripts` block

This will allow you to have a consistent Gradle task interface between your NPM + Java projects. You should be able to
run commands like the following:

```bash
./gradlew build -x check
```

It will build your NPM package without running the tests.


Tasks
-----
The following tasks are added:

- `clean` - Runs `npm run clean`
- `test` - Runs `npm run test`
- `check` - Depends on `:test`
- `build` - Runs `npm run build` and depends on `:check`. Builds the production-ready version of the assets.
- `buildDev` - Runs `npm run buildDev` and depends on `:check`. Builds the development-mode version of the assets.


Configuration
-------------
You can configure the `npm run *` commands in your `build.gradle`. Here's an example:

```groovy
npmRun {
    clean       "other-clean"       // defaults to "clean"
    test        "other-test"        // defaults to "test"
    build       "other-build"       // defaults to "build"
    buildDev    "other-buildDev"    // defaults to "buildDev"
}
```
